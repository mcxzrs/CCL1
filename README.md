## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Physics and Movement:** I enjoyed creating my own function for gravity and honing collision for my movement. Jump could be better in theory, but i'm still happy with how the character feels in my game
- **Core Mechanics:** Dodging the fire and quickly moving through the level feel nice and i'm happy with how it turned out

### Challenges:
- **Creative Design:** Making animations for coins and fire were a problem for me. They turned out ok, but it was hard for me. Same goes for the panic room background. Thankfully i got help with main background and downloaded free assets for the character. 
- **Bug Fixes and troubleshooting:** Sometimes it was fun, but in some cases when i couldn't even fathom why the game doesn't work it got really frustrating.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Working on the template first:** Rather then creating full game from start, it's better to master your codebase and make it as extendable and scalable as you can. After that, it's rather easy to add anything you want.
- **Work on documentation from the start:** I never document my code usually, which is a big no-no. Because of that it's very hard to come back to the code and try to remember where i finished or what i did on last session. So in the future i'll pay more attention to documenting my code.
